Contains Richard's project code, created as part of Stanford's Code in Place CS106A course held in Spring of 2020.

The code itself is an educational quiz based on my brother-in-law's 5th grade curriculum. 

Please download all of the files and keep them in the same folder for the code to work correctly.
